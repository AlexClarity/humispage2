        <div class="content">
          <p>The History faculty strives to make outstanding scholarly contributions to the discipline
            and to instill historical knowledge, perspective on human experience, critical thinking
            skills, and effective writing in all our graduate and undergraduate students. We are
            also a community of citizens engaged in service and devoted to the enrichment of
            intellectual and public life at the University, throughout Utah, and beyond.</p>

          <p>We offer the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. History students can explore periods and regions ranging
            from ancient Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome to the modern Middle East, Asia, Europe, and the Americas.
            Our faculty specializes in topics that include politics, diplomacy, warfare, and intellectual life as well as gender and women’s history, medicine and science,
            colonialism and intercultural contact, religious expression and practices, and environmental history.
            Our curriculum reflects long-standing disciplinary tradition in its organization by region, nation-state,
            and time period, but it also embodies a newer orientation toward transnational, comparative, and
            thematic courses. Faculty involvement in Middle Eastern Studies, Gender Studies, Asian Studies, Ethnic Studies, International Studies,
            Latin American Studies, and Environmental Studies reflects the department’s longstanding commitment to interdisciplinary programs.</p>
          <p>History courses emphasize written and oral skills, analysis and critical thinking, and
            the ability to assess conflicting interpretations. These skills prepare students for the
            responsibilities of citizenship and cultivate an awareness of the complexities of life.
            History provides valuable preparation for careers in university and college teaching
            and research, primary and secondary education, law, government, public service,
            journalism, libraries and museums, international business, and medicine.</p>
